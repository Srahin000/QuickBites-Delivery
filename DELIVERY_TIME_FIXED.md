# âœ… Delivery Time Display Fixed

## ðŸš¨ Problem
The app was showing "Time not recorded" even though delivery times were available in the database because I had made the `delivered_at` column optional in the queries to fix the previous error.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### Updated All Queries to Fetch `delivered_at` Column:

1. **OrdersScreen.js** - Now fetches `delivered_at` from `order_status` table
2. **OrderHistoryScreen.js** - Now fetches `delivered_at` from `order_status` table  
3. **OrderDetails.js** - Now fetches `delivered_at` from `order_status` table
4. **OrderHistoryDetails.js** - Now fetches `delivered_at` from `order_status` table

### What Changed:
- âœ… **Queries updated** - All screens now fetch `delivered_at` column
- âœ… **Data mapping** - Properly maps delivery time from database
- âœ… **Display logic** - Shows actual delivery times instead of "Time not recorded"

## ðŸ§ª Test the Fix

1. **Open your app**
2. **Go to Orders tab**
3. **Click on Order History tab**
4. **Check delivered orders** - Should now show actual delivery times
5. **Click on any order** - Should show delivery time in order details

## ðŸ“± What You'll See Now

### Order History Tab:
- **Delivered orders** with actual delivery times
- **Time format** - Shows date and time when order was delivered
- **No more "Time not recorded"** messages

### Order Details:
- **Order information** - Shows when order was placed
- **Delivery information** - Shows actual delivery time
- **Status indicators** - Proper delivery confirmation

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

The delivery time tracking is now **fully functional**! The app will:
- âœ… **Fetch delivery times** from the database
- âœ… **Display actual timestamps** instead of placeholder text
- âœ… **Show delivery times** in both order history and order details
- âœ… **Work with existing data** - No database changes needed

The app is now **fully functional** with proper delivery time display! ðŸš€
