# âœ… Navigation Error Fixed

## ðŸš¨ Problem Fixed
**Error**: `The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload {"name":"DeliveryScreen"...} was not handled by any navigator.`

**Root Cause**: The navigation file registers the screen as `"Delivery"` but the code was trying to navigate to `"DeliveryScreen"`.

## ðŸ”§ Solution Applied

### **Navigation Screen Names**:
- **Registered as**: `"Delivery"` (in navigation.js)
- **Code was calling**: `"DeliveryScreen"` (incorrect)

### **Files Fixed**:
1. **CartScreen.js** - Updated navigation calls
2. **TabCartScreen.js** - Updated navigation calls

### **Changes Made**:
```javascript
// Before (causing error):
navigation.navigate('DeliveryScreen', { ... });

// After (fixed):
navigation.navigate('Delivery', { ... });
```

## âœ… Current Status

- âœ… **Navigation fixed** - All calls now use correct screen name
- âœ… **No more navigation errors** - App can properly navigate to delivery screen
- âœ… **Order flow working** - Complete order placement and delivery screen display

The order placement should now work perfectly and navigate to the delivery screen without any errors! ðŸš€
